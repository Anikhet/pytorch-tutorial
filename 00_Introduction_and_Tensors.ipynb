    "# RANDOM SEEDS EXPLAINED - Why and What They Do\n",
    "# ============================================================================\n",
    "# \n",
    "# WHAT IS A RANDOM SEED?\n",
    "# ----------------------\n",
    "# A random seed is a starting point for generating random numbers. \n",
    "# Computers don't generate truly random numbers - they use algorithms called\n",
    "# \"pseudo-random number generators\" (PRNGs) that produce sequences that LOOK\n",
    "# random but are actually deterministic (predictable if you know the seed).\n",
    "#\n",
    "# WHY SET A RANDOM SEED?\n",
    "# ----------------------\n",
    "# 1. **Reproducibility**: Get the same \"random\" numbers every time you run your code\n",
    "#    - Critical for debugging: if something breaks, you can reproduce it exactly\n",
    "#    - Essential for sharing code: others get the same results as you\n",
    "#    - Important for experiments: compare results across different runs\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 2. **Consistency in Machine Learning**:\n",
    "#    - Neural network weights are initialized randomly\n",
    "#    - Data shuffling is random\n",
    "#    - Dropout layers use randomness\n",
    "#    - Without a seed, you'd get different results each run, making it hard to:\n",
    "#      * Debug issues\n",
    "#      * Compare different models fairly\n",
    "#      * Reproduce published results\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 3. **Testing and Validation**:\n",
    "#    - Unit tests need predictable behavior\n",
    "#    - You want to verify your code works the same way every time\n",
    "#\n",
    "# HOW DOES IT WORK?\n",
    "# -----------------\n",
    "# When you set a seed, you're telling the random number generator:\n",
    "# \"Start your sequence from this specific point\"\n",
    "# \n",
    "# Same seed → Same sequence of \"random\" numbers\n",
    "# Different seed → Different sequence\n",
    "# No seed → Different sequence each time (truly unpredictable)\n",
    "#\n",
    "# EXAMPLE:\n",
    "# --------\n",
    "# Without seed:        With seed(42):\n",
    "# Run 1: [0.3, 0.7, 0.1]  Run 1: [0.4, 0.8, 0.2]\n",
    "# Run 2: [0.9, 0.2, 0.5]  Run 2: [0.4, 0.8, 0.2]  ← Same!\n",
    "# Run 3: [0.6, 0.1, 0.9]  Run 3: [0.4, 0.8, 0.2]  ← Same!\n",
    "#\n",
    "# WHY 42?\n",
    "# -------\n",
    "# It's a common convention (from \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\")\n",
    "# You can use any number - 0, 1, 123, 999, etc. The specific value doesn't matter,\n",
    "# but using the SAME value ensures reproducibility.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# IMPORTANT NOTES:\n",
    "# ----------------\n",
    "# - torch.manual_seed() sets the seed for PyTorch's random number generator\n",
    "# - np.random.seed() sets the seed for NumPy's random number generator\n",
    "# - You need BOTH if you use both libraries (which we do!)\n",
    "# - Seeds only affect the SEQUENCE, not the DISTRIBUTION of random numbers\n",
    "#   (you still get random-looking numbers, just the same ones each time)\n",

    "1. **Tensors** are multi-dimensional arrays, similar to NumPy arrays but with GPU support\n",
    "2. **Creating tensors**: Use `torch.tensor()`, `torch.zeros()`, `torch.ones()`, `torch.rand()`, etc.\n",
    "3. **Operations**: Element-wise (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) vs matrix multiplication (`@` or `torch.matmul()`)\n",
    "4. **Shape matters**: Use `.shape` to check dimensions, `.reshape()` to change them\n",
    "5. **Data types**: Specify with `dtype` parameter, convert with `.float()`, `.int()`, etc.\n",
    "6. **Indexing**: Works like NumPy - use `[row, col]` or slices `[start:end]`\n",
    "7. **Device**: Tensors default to CPU; can move to GPU with `.cuda()` if available\n",

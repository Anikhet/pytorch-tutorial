    "\n",
    "### 1. Dataset (`torch.utils.data.Dataset`)\n",
    "- A class that knows where your data is and how to get one item.\n",
    "- It must implement `__len__` (How big am I?) and `__getitem__` (Give me item #5).\n",
    "- Analogy: A Librarian who knows where every book is.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. DataLoader (`torch.utils.data.DataLoader`)\n",
    "- A worker that grabs items from the Dataset and bundles them into Batches.\n",
    "- It handles shuffling and parallel loading (using multiple CPU cores).\n",
    "- Analogy: A Delivery Driver who packs books into boxes and brings them to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Batch Size\n",
    "- How many items the DataLoader puts in one box.\n",
    "- **Small Batch (e.g., 1)**: Noisy updates, slow training.\n",
    "- **Large Batch (e.g., 1000)**: Stable updates, memory hungry.\n",
    "- **Sweet Spot**: Usually 32, 64, or 128.\n",

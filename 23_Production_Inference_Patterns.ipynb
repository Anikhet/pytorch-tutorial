The model was trained on one \"version\" of the data but sees a different version in production.\n\n**Common causes**:\n1. **Different code paths**: Training preprocesses data in Python/Pandas, serving preprocesses in Java/Go — subtle differences accumulate\n2. **Time leakage**: Training uses features computed with future information that's unavailable at prediction time\n3. **Stale features**: Feature store hasn't been updated, so serving uses outdated values\n4. **Different library versions**: NumPy or Pandas version difference causes rounding differences\n\n**How to prevent it**: The Feature Store pattern solves this by computing features exactly once and storing them. Both training and serving read from the same store, guaranteeing consistency.\n\n### Feature Store Deep Dive\n\nA Feature Store is a centralized repository that manages the lifecycle of ML features:\n\n```\nRaw Data → Feature Pipeline → Feature Store → {Training, Serving}\n                                    │\n                              ┌─────┴─────┐\n                              │ Offline    │ ← Historical features for training\n                              │ (batch)    │    (e.g., Hive/S3/BigQuery)\n                              ├────────────┤\n                              │ Online     │ ← Low-latency features for serving\n                              │ (real-time)│    (e.g., Redis/DynamoDB)\n                              └────────────┘\n```\n\nPopular Feature Stores: **Feast** (open-source), **Tecton** (managed), **Hopsworks** (open-source), **Databricks Feature Store**"

   "source": "## Part 4: Model Monitoring & Drift Detection\n\n### What to Monitor\n\n#### 1. Input Distribution Drift (Data Drift)\nAre the inputs changing over time? For example, if your fraud detection model was trained on transactions averaging $50, but now the average is $500 (holiday season), the model may perform poorly.\n\n**Types of drift**:\n- **Covariate shift**: Input distribution changes (most common)\n- **Concept drift**: The relationship between inputs and outputs changes (e.g., \"fraud patterns\" evolve)\n- **Label drift**: The distribution of labels changes (e.g., fraud rate increases)\n\n#### 2. Output Distribution Drift  \nAre the predictions changing? A sudden shift in prediction distribution (e.g., the model predicts \"fraud\" 10x more than yesterday) indicates something is wrong — either the inputs changed or the model is malfunctioning.\n\n#### 3. Performance Metrics\nWhen labels arrive, how accurate is the model? In many production systems, ground truth labels arrive with a delay (e.g., you know if a transaction was actually fraud only after investigation, which could take days).\n\n#### 4. System Metrics\nLatency (P50, P95, P99), throughput (requests/sec), error rate, GPU utilization, memory usage.\n\n### PSI (Population Stability Index) — The Standard Drift Metric\n\nPSI compares two distributions by measuring how much one has \"shifted\" from the other:\n\n$$ PSI = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (p_i^{current} - p_i^{baseline}) \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_i^{current}}{p_i^{baseline}}\\right) $$\n\nInterpretation thresholds:\n- **PSI < 0.1**: No drift — distributions are stable\n- **PSI 0.1 - 0.2**: Moderate drift — investigate, consider retraining\n- **PSI > 0.2**: Significant drift — retrain the model\n\n**Why PSI over simpler metrics?** A simple mean/variance comparison can miss distribution shape changes. PSI compares the full histogram, catching subtle shifts like bimodal distributions or tail changes."

The gradual rollout catches problems early before they affect all users.\n\n**What to monitor during canary**: Compare error rates, latency, and business metrics (revenue, engagement) between canary and control traffic. If the canary shows degradation, roll back immediately.\n\n### Pattern 2: Blue-Green Deployment\nRun two environments, switch traffic instantly.\n\n```\nBlue (Old Model v1) ← 100% traffic\nGreen (New Model v2) ← 0% traffic (testing)\n            ↓ (when ready)\nBlue ← 0% traffic\nGreen ← 100% traffic (instant switch!)\n```\n\n**Benefit**: Instant rollback if issues detected — just switch traffic back to Blue.\n\n**When to use**: When you need zero-downtime deployment and fast rollback. More expensive (2x infrastructure) but safer for critical systems.\n\n### Pattern 3: Shadow Deployment\nRun the new model alongside production without serving its predictions to users.\n\n```\n100% traffic → Model v1 → Serve to users\n      └─────→ Model v2 → Log predictions (but don't serve)\n```\n\nCompare predictions offline. Only promote v2 when its logged predictions consistently outperform v1.\n\n**When to use**: High-risk models (medical, financial) where you need extensive validation before serving.\n\n### Pattern 4: A/B Testing\nRun two models simultaneously, compare business metrics.\n\n```\n50% users → Model A → Track revenue, engagement\n50% users → Model B → Track revenue, engagement\n            ↓ (after 1-2 weeks)\nChoose winner based on business metrics\n```\n\n**Key**: Don't just compare model metrics (AUC, F1) — compare business metrics (revenue, engagement)! A model with lower AUC might actually drive more revenue due to better calibration or different failure modes.\n\n### Statistical Rigor in A/B Tests\n\nCommon mistakes that lead to wrong conclusions:\n1. **Peeking**: Checking results daily and stopping when p < 0.05. This inflates false positive rate from 5% to 25%+. Use sequential testing or wait for the predetermined sample size.\n2. **Underpowered tests**: Not enough samples to detect small effects. Calculate required sample size before starting.\n3. **Multiple comparisons**: Testing 20 metrics and declaring victory when one is significant. Apply Bonferroni correction.\n4. **Network effects**: User A's experience changes user B's behavior (social networks). Use cluster randomization."

    "### Core Principles\n",
    "1. **FTI Pipeline Architecture**: Separate feature, training, and inference pipelines\n",
    "2. **Choose the Right Pattern**: Batch for cost, online for latency\n",
    "3. **Monitor Everything**: Drift, performance, costs\n",
    "4. **Deploy Safely**: Canary, blue-green, A/B testing\n",
    "5. **Optimize Costs**: Inference is 90% of expenses!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technology Stack\n",
    "- **Feature Store**: Feast, Tecton\n",
    "- **Model Registry**: MLflow, Weights & Biases\n",
    "- **Orchestration**: Airflow, Prefect, Dagster\n",
    "- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, Evidently\n",
    "- **Deployment**: Kubernetes, Docker\n",
    "- **Serving**: FastAPI, vLLM, TensorRT-LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "### What FAANG Expects\n",
    "✅ Understanding of FTI pipeline architecture\n",
    "✅ Ability to choose batch vs online correctly\n",
    "✅ Experience with monitoring and drift detection\n",
    "✅ Knowledge of cost optimization strategies\n",
    "✅ Familiarity with safe deployment patterns\n",
    "✅ A/B testing and experimentation skills\n",
    "✅ Production debugging and incident response\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n",
    "❌ Deploying without monitoring\n",
    "❌ Ignoring training-serving skew\n",
    "❌ 100% rollout without testing\n",
    "❌ Not tracking business metrics\n",
    "❌ Neglecting cost optimization\n",
    "❌ No rollback plan\n",
